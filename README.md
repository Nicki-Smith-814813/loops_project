# Loops Project

## Description
This C++ program is a simple utility tool that demonstrates various loop constructs through different features:
- Factorial Calculator (while loop)
- Number Pyramid (nested for loops)
- Sum of Even or Odd Numbers (do-while loop)
- String Reversal (while loop)
- Fibonacci Sequences
- Palindrome Checker
  
The program is menu-driven and allows users to interact with all the options repeatedly until they choose to exit.

## Compilation & Execution (in GitHub CodeSpaces)

1. Open the `loops_project.cpp` file in CodeSpaces.
2. Compile using the terminal:
